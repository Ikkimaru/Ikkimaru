## Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è

My journey in coding has been quite the adventure, filled with ups and downs, as I've navigated through study and hands-on experience. From my early days of learning programming concepts to taking on the challenge of lecturing, I've learned that coding is as much about problem-solving as it is about writing lines of code. Each project I've tackled has taught me valuable lessons‚Äîwhether debugging a stubborn error or figuring out how to optimize my code. The thrill of seeing my ideas come to life, especially in my current projects like the GolfTracker app helps keep me motivated to learn and improve. Right now, I‚Äôm diving into JavaScript courses on Udemy and exploring the MEAN stack, opening up new avenues for my development skills.

Outside of coding, I‚Äôm passionate about golf, motorcycle riding, and playing computer games. These interests provide a great balance in my life and inspire my work. For instance, developing the GolfTracker app merges my love for golf with my programming skills, allowing me to create something meaningful for myself and fellow golf enthusiasts. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me out on a ride or immersed in a new game, always looking for fresh ideas and inspiration. Each of these experiences shapes my coding journey, reminding me there's always something new to learn and explore.

Here's my current handicap index: üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **<!--HI-->old_value<!--HI-->**, which updates every Monday, if it lowers, my GolfTracker app is working.
